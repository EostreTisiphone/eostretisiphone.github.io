## Who am I?
My name is Ellinor, I'm 24 years old and currently studing UDM at Linn√©universitetet. I have a little bit of previous experience with programming, as I before starting this program read a few stray courses on the subject.

My interests are somewhat difficult to describe, as they're quite scattered and change from month to month, but generally I like most things that keep my hands busy - whether it be playing piano, knitting, caligraphy, video games or programming.

One constant is my cats, who are amazingly cute but who can also be a real pain - they always seem to want to climb on my keyboard when I'm doing something important. At least they taught me the true value of keeping backups of my work!
