So... I have to eat my words about how installing a theme was painless. It was - until I realised the theme wasn't compatible with github pages. As you can see, I've reverted back to the minima-theme, and the website is not much to look at.

I've been sitting here trying to wrestle the theme into working in a bunch of different ways for hours now, but now I give up for the night. So the site will have to look like this for now, and I'm going to miss the deadline. It's not that I expected everything to neccecarily go super smooth when uploading the site, but I honestly didn't expect it to go this bad. Serves me right for getting seduced by the looks of a theme, without properly looking into its compatability.
