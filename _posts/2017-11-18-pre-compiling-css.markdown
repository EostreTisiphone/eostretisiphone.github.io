### Regular CSS
I'm going to start this post off by expressing my hatred for CSS. My experiences have almost exclusively been bad, no other language have made me want to rip my hair out nearly as much as CSS has.

I don't have a lot of experience working with CSS, and I'm sure some of the issues I have with it are bound to get easier as you learn more. However there are issues with CSS that I doubt will get solved - no matter how much you learn, such as limited means of organising your code and a syntax that makes it impossible to work by the golden rule of programming - "Do not repeat yourself.".

### Pre-compiled CSS
Pre-compiling your CSS do - I believe - solve a lot of these issues. The pre-processor syntax I've worked with is SCSS, however from my understanding most of the different options work to solve the same issues. SCSS adds things such as using variables, mixins, inheritence, and better syntax for nesting your code.
